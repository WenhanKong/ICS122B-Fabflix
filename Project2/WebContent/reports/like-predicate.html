		<p>
			I used the most simple pattern LIKE  which is provided by mysql.</p>
		<p>
			for movie title, I used LIKE %movie_name% to predict;</p>
		<p>
			for movie year, I used LIKE 'year';</p>
		<p>
			for movie director, I used LIKE %director%;</p>
		<p>
			for name, I split name into two firstname and lastname, then use "name like '%full_name[0]%'
				OR s.name like '% full_name[1] %'" to predict;
